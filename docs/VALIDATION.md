# Validation scoreboard

The validation harness is the single quality scoreboard for public synthetic
fixtures, contract-safe recorded results, and release licensing. It reports
case-level failures as well as aggregate metrics. It does not tune detector
parameters or read private research data during the public run.

The checked-in public suite is a synthetic metric-contract smoke. It exercises
calculators, gates, report generation, split metadata, and manifest-policy
plumbing. Its scores and timing are not detector accuracy, inference runtime,
or end-to-end application performance evidence.

## Run the public scoreboard

From the repository root, run:

```powershell
dotnet run -c Release --project tools/GraphReader.Benchmarks -- --suite public
```

The command writes reports beneath:

```text
artifacts/validation/public-scoreboard/
  public-scoreboard.json
  public-scoreboard.md
  public-scoreboard.html
```

Use `--output <directory>` to choose a different report directory. The process
returns `0` only when every regression gate passes, `1` when a quality gate
fails, and `2` for invalid arguments, cancellation, or an output failure.
Private evaluation cannot be selected through this executable.

The JSON report is the automation interface. Every format carries the evidence
scope warning. The Markdown and HTML reports are
human-readable views of the same deterministic scoreboard. Each format records
the case and module identity, measured value, required threshold, gate result,
timing, and peak managed memory. A failed run also writes each failure to
standard error as `FAIL [module/case] gate: detail`.

## Regression thresholds

The checked-in threshold catalog is authoritative. Threshold comparisons use
the direction shown below. A value equal to its threshold passes.

| Metric ID | Pass condition |
| --- | ---: |
| `marker_center_precision_3px` | at least `0.80` |
| `marker_center_recall_3px` | at least `0.80` |
| `marker_center_f1_3px` | at least `0.80` |
| `marker_center_precision_5px` | at least `0.90` |
| `marker_center_recall_5px` | at least `0.90` |
| `marker_center_f1_5px` | at least `0.90` |
| `duplicate_detection_rate` | at most `0.05` |
| `false_positives_per_megapixel` | at most `0.50` |
| `shape_macro_f1` | at least `0.80` |
| `fill_state_macro_f1` | at least `0.80` |
| `axis_anchor_error_px` | at most `3.0` px |
| `calibration_rmse_graph_units` | at most `1.0` graph unit |
| `x_tick_numeric_exact_match` | at least `0.90` |
| `y_tick_numeric_exact_match` | at least `0.90` |
| `ocr_character_error_rate` | at most `0.10` |

| `legend_mapping_accuracy` | at least `0.85` |
| `phase_divider_error_px` | at most `3.0` px |
| `phase_divider_error_sessions` | at most `1.0` session |
| `phase_assignment_f1` | at least `0.90` |
| `csv_point_precision` | at least `0.95` |
| `csv_point_recall` | at least `0.95` |
| `y_mae_axis_range_percent` | at most `2.0%` |
| `exact_phase_code_accuracy` | at least `0.95` |
| `cold_runtime_ms` | at most `6000.0` ms |
| `warm_runtime_ms` | at most `2000.0` ms |
| `peak_memory_bytes` | at most `1,073,741,824` bytes |
| `confidence_expected_calibration_error` | at most `0.10` |
| `confidence_brier_score` | at most `0.10` |

Thresholds are release gates, not detector tuning knobs. Change them only as a
reviewed validation-policy change supported by held-out evidence. Never lower a
threshold to make one fixture pass.

## Dataset and split safety

Public scoring uses synthetic or openly licensed fixtures only. Synthetic
families are held out by renderer, font, degradation recipe, chart template,
and marker-style family where those fields apply.

Real-case metadata must include a stable article identifier. The split
validator groups at article level and rejects a dataset when panels from one
article appear in more than one of train, validation, or test. Panel-level or
image-level random splitting is not an acceptable substitute. Private study
data is evaluation-only unless separate, explicit permission authorizes
training.

## Private evaluation safety

Private evaluation is deliberately unavailable by default. The local adapter
returns availability only when all of these conditions hold:

1. The caller explicitly opts in for the current invocation.
2. No supported continuous-integration environment variable is enabled.
3. The configured directory exists.
4. Both the configured path and its resolved link target are outside the
   repository.

Unavailable runs return structured reason codes:

- `ExplicitOptInRequired`
- `ContinuousIntegrationDetected`
- `ExternalDirectoryRequired`
- `ExternalDirectoryNotFound`
- `ExternalDirectoryMustBeOutsideRepository`
- `ExternalDirectoryCouldNotBeResolved`

The adapter does not enumerate, read, copy, or write private case data. Keep
private images, annotations, and evaluator outputs in the external directory.
Do not place them under the repository, include them in public reports, or use
them in CI. The supplied-example specification records expected roles and
exclusions only. It includes no image and leaves unobserved point counts,
coordinates, graph y values, and scientific series labels unspecified.

## License release gate

The public scoreboard runs a license-policy check over every JSON model
manifest. It requires a model ID, a 64-character hexadecimal checksum,
`commercial_use: true`, a nonempty SPDX expression, `license.reviewed: true`,
and a notice path that exists inside the repository. It rejects SPDX values
containing GPL, AGPL, SSPL, BUSL, or non-commercial markers. A bundled model
also fails when its manifest declares `redistribution: false`.

This check does not prove that an unbundled declared weight exists or that its
bytes match the manifest checksum. Artifact checksum verification and full
frozen-schema validation remain separate release checks. A model with missing
or non-redistributable weights remains blocked even if this license-policy
check passes. Both Windows distributions must use the same reviewed manifests,
model checksums, and notice set.

## Interpret the reports

Read gate status before aggregate averages. A high overall score does not hide
a module/case failure. Marker center precision, recall, and F1 are reported at
both 3-pixel and 5-pixel tolerances using one-to-one matching. Duplicate rate
and false positives per megapixel remain separate so repeated detections and
background artifacts are visible.

Shape and fill macro-F1 weight classes equally. Axis, calibration, OCR,
grouping, legend, phase, CSV, and confidence-calibration metrics diagnose their
own modules. Timing and peak managed memory are evidence, not accuracy scores.
Compare cold and warm timing only with equivalent hardware, providers, fixture
sets, and build configuration.

A public `PASS` means the synthetic metric-contract smoke and manifest-policy
gate met the catalog thresholds in that run. It is not detector accuracy or
end-to-end performance evidence. It is also not evidence that private article
cases passed, that all research graphs are supported, or that a model may be
redistributed without the separate provenance review.
